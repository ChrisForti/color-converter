# ðŸŒŸ Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Functionality âœ…

- [x] Project setup and Tailwind integration
- [x] Color mapping system design
- [x] Basic demo implementation
- [x] GitHub repository setup with CI/CD
- [x] Live deployment to GitHub Pages

## Phase 2: Parser & Engine âœ…

- [x] Tailwind class parser (supports complex patterns: hover:md:bg-blue-500)
- [x] Color mapping logic (smart shade preservation, validation)
- [x] Interactive preview component (real-time before/after comparison)
- [x] Custom mapping creation (user-defined color schemes)
- [x] Built-in presets (6 themes: warm, nature, minimal, etc.)
- [x] Robust validation and error handling

## Phase 3: Advanced Features ðŸ”„

- [ ] CLI interface
- [ ] Batch file processing (scan directories, convert multiple files)
- [ ] Browser extension
- [ ] Advanced pattern support (group modifiers, complex responsive variants)
- [ ] Configuration export/import (JSON files)
- [ ] Dark mode detection and handling

## Phase 4: Polish & Distribution ðŸš€

- [ ] Comprehensive testing suite
- [ ] Enhanced documentation
- [ ] NPM package
- [ ] VS Code extension
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] Accessibility improvements

## Current Status

**Completed Features:**

- âœ… Smart color extraction and mapping
- âœ… Real-time interactive preview with live code editor
- âœ… Custom color scheme creation with validation
- âœ… Side-by-side before/after comparison
- âœ… Error handling for edge cases
- âœ… GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- âœ… Live demo deployment

**Next Priority:**

- CLI interface for command-line usage
- Batch file processing for large projects
- Enhanced pattern support for complex Tailwind variants

The core functionality is complete and the tool is fully usable for interactive color scheme conversion!
