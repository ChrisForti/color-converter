# Color Scheme Converter Tool

Yes, this is absolutely possible! There are several approaches you can take, each with different trade-offs:

## Approaches

**1. Browser Extension (Most Practical)**
A Chrome/Firefox extension that injects CSS to override colors. This works on any site and persists across sessions.

**2. Proxy/Wrapper App**
Your app fetches and renders another app's HTML, then modifies it before display. Works but has CORS limitations.

**3. Build-Time Color Scheme Converter (Best for Your Own Apps)**
Since you use Tailwind, you can create a tool that parses your codebase and converts color classes systematically.

Let me create a practical solution for you - a color scheme converter tool that can:
- Parse Tailwind classes from your HTML/JSX files
- Map them to a new color palette
- Generate a conversion configuration file
- Preview changes in real-time

## Tailwind Color Scheme Converter

This tool will help you:

- **Visualize color conversions** - See before/after previews
- **Generate conversion configs** - Export mappings as JSON
- **Auto-detect colors** - Finds all Tailwind colors in your code
- **Test changes live** - Preview conversions before applying

## Next Steps for Full Implementation

For a complete solution, you'd want to add:

- **Batch File Processing** - Script to process multiple files
- **CLI Tool** - Run conversions via command line
- **VSCode Extension** - Real-time preview in your editor
- **Find & Replace Script** - Automate the actual file modifications

## Additional Tools We Could Build

Would you like me to create any of these additional tools? For example, I could build:

1. **A Node.js script that processes all files in a directory**
2. **A browser extension that live-modifies any website's colors**
3. **A more sophisticated parser that handles complex Tailwind patterns** (group-hover, dark mode variants, etc.)

## Features

- Interactive artifact for real-time testing
- Color mapping visualization
- Export functionality for conversion configurations
- Support for common Tailwind color patterns
- Preview capabilities before applying changes
